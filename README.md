# Ultrasonic_Sensor_Library
HC SR04 ultrasonic sensor library for using on Arduino IDE.

The present library is oriented to an specific configuration of the HC-SR04 sensor, the reset option differs from other librarys due to the differences between cheap china made sensors and original manufacturer ones. Most of the ultrasonic libraries that have been actually made don't work fine when reseting a cheap sensor.

That's the main reason of this library: to be able to run in a correct way in any HC-SR04 sensor, despite its manufacturer.
